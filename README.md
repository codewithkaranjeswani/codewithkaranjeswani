# Karan Jeswani :vulcan_salute: :technologist:

- I like to build cool and useful stuff and put it on the internet.
- I love Programming, solving problems, puzzles and riddles (I like it more when I would have to write programs to solve said problems, hence I like competitive programming). What I like even more is when I learn about a concept using some of these problems or riddles, because the best way to learn is by doing!
- My greatest academic achievement as of now is being able to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), on Image to Image translation, and I am proud of it.
- I am interested in making contributions towards the progress of reseaerch in Deep Learning, and also in applying these solutions on real world datasets.
- I am constantly learning and growing in the field of Image-to-Image Translation using conditional-GANs.

### Some random ideas in my head right now:
- Why is there no reinforcement learning framework like Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for segmentation networks. I think this would be a nice way to find better encoder-decoder architectures as well. (I know of the NAS used for ImageNet classification, through this paper on Efficient Net by Google)

### Ways to contact me:
- I would appreciate more followers on Twitter: @karanjeswani306
